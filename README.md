This is a very simple serial interface for the USB output of the Æ20401 AE20401 5.8 GHz Frequency Counter / RF Power Meter from Ascel Electronic [https://www.ascel-electronic.de/kits/14/ae20401-5.8-ghz-frequency-counter/rf-power-meter]

The code should be portable since it is pure python.  It has been written and tested under linux since the manufacturer supplied software is windows native.

The system has basic logging functionality.  Let me know if you see this project and are interested.
