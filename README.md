# AE20401-logger
Graph and record data from an Ascel Æ20401 over USB

This is a very simple serial interface for the USB output of the Æ20401 5.8 GHz Frequency Counter/Power meter

The code should be portable since it is pure python.  It has been written and tested under linux since the manufacturer supplied software is windows native.

So far only the counter is implemented, this is just a simple proof-of-concept.  Better parsing etc to follow.

Let me know if you see this project and are interested.
